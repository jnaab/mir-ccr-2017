The goal of the workshop was to provide a forum for researchers in the Munich
area working on networking research to exchange ideas and develop further
collaoborations on similar interests.

In this workshop, we invited presentations on topics such as: (a) \ac{SDN},
(b) \ac{NFV}, (c) \ac{ICN}, (d) \ac{IoT}, (e) Internet measurements and (f)
security research.  On the basis of accepted proposals, the workshop was
organized in four sessions describing: (a) invited presentations, (b) parallel
group work, and (c) posters. We had 10 invited presentations on covering the
aforementioned topics and 11 posters presenting upcoming research. We also
organized 6 breakout sessions to discuss open topics in an informal setting.
A synopses of these four sessions appear in the upcoming sections below.
