Participants were also encouraged to volunteer to bring a poster to provide a
perspective into their recent measurement research work.

\subsection{The cost of Security in the SDN control Plane}

In OpenFlow enabled Software Defined Networks (SDNs) network control is
carried out remotely via a control connection. In order to deploy OpenFlow in
production networks, security of the control connection is crucial. For
OpenFlow connections TLS encryption is recommended by the specification. In
this work, we analyze the TLS support in the OpenFlow eco-system. In
particular, we implemented a performance measurement tool for encrypted
OpenFlow connections, as there is non available.  Our first results show that
security comes at an extra cost and hence further work is needed to design
efficient mechanisms taking the security-delay trade-off into account.

\item Poster: THE BALTIKUM TESTBED - Selected activities in the Baltikum Testbed

Abstract: The poster showed a high-level overview to the recent activities in the
Baltikum Testbed. The testbed which is focussed on performance
measurements of x86-based packet processing systems provides an
automated, documented, and reproducible experiment workflow. The poster
presented several activities, comprising the load generator MoonGen,
automated benchmarks of routers and OpenFlow switches, and different
performance studies, including an IPsec gateway with NIC-offloading.
