Participants were also encouraged to volunteer to bring a poster to provide a
perspective into their recent measurement research work.

\subsection{The cost of Security in the SDN control Plane}

In OpenFlow enabled Software Defined Networks (SDNs) network control is
carried out remotely via a control connection. In order to deploy OpenFlow in
production networks, security of the control connection is crucial. For
OpenFlow connections TLS encryption is recommended by the specification. In
this work, we analyze the TLS support in the OpenFlow eco-system. In
particular, we implemented a performance measurement tool for encrypted
OpenFlow connections, as there is non available.  Our first results show that
security comes at an extra cost and hence further work is needed to design
efficient mechanisms taking the security-delay trade-off into account.

\subsection{THE BALTIKUM TESTBED - Selected activities in the Baltikum Testbed}

The poster showed a high-level overview to the recent activities in the
Baltikum Testbed. The testbed which is focussed on performance measurements of
x86-based packet processing systems provides an automated, documented, and
reproducible experiment workflow. The poster presented several activities,
comprising the load generator MoonGen, automated benchmarks of routers and
OpenFlow switches, and different performance studies, including an IPsec
gateway with NIC-offloading.

\subsection{Boost Virtual Network Resource Allocation: Using Machine Learning for Optimization}

Rapidly and efficiently allocating virtual network resources, i.e., 
solving the online Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem is 
important in particular for future communication networks. We 
propose a system using an admission control to improve the performance 
for the online VNE problem. The admission control implements a Neural 
Network that classifies virtual network requests based on network 
representations, which are using graph and network resource features 
only. Via simulations, we demonstrate that the admission control, 
i.e., the Neural Network filters virtual network requests that are 
either infeasible or that need too long for being efficiently 
processed. Thus, our admission control reduces the overall system 
runtime, i.e., it improves the overall calculation efficiency for 
the online VNE problem.
Generally, we demonstrate the ability to learn from the history 
of VNE algorithms. We show that it is possible to learn the behavior 
of algorithms and how to integrate this knowledge when solving future 
problem instances.
