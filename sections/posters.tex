Participants were also encouraged to volunteer to bring a poster to provide a
perspective into their recent measurement research work.

\subsection{The cost of Security in the SDN control Plane}

In OpenFlow enabled Software Defined Networks (SDNs) network control is
carried out remotely via a control connection. In order to deploy OpenFlow in
production networks, security of the control connection is crucial. For
OpenFlow connections TLS encryption is recommended by the specification. In
this work, we analyze the TLS support in the OpenFlow eco-system. In
particular, we implemented a performance measurement tool for encrypted
OpenFlow connections, as there is non available.  Our first results show that
security comes at an extra cost and hence further work is needed to design
efficient mechanisms taking the security-delay trade-off into account.

\subsection{THE BALTIKUM TESTBED - Selected activities in the Baltikum Testbed}

The poster showed a high-level overview to the recent activities in the
Baltikum Testbed. The testbed which is focussed on performance measurements of
x86-based packet processing systems provides an automated, documented, and
reproducible experiment workflow. The poster presented several activities,
comprising the load generator MoonGen, automated benchmarks of routers and
OpenFlow switches, and different performance studies, including an IPsec
gateway with NIC-offloading.

\subsection{Boost Virtual Network Resource Allocation: Using Machine Learning for Optimization}

Rapidly and efficiently allocating virtual network resources, i.e.,
solving the online Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem is
important in particular for future communication networks. We
propose a system using an admission control to improve the performance
for the online VNE problem. The admission control implements a Neural
Network that classifies virtual network requests based on network
representations, which are using graph and network resource features
only. Via simulations, we demonstrate that the admission control,
i.e., the Neural Network filters virtual network requests that are
either infeasible or that need too long for being efficiently
processed. Thus, our admission control reduces the overall system
runtime, i.e., it improves the overall calculation efficiency for
the online VNE problem.
Generally, we demonstrate the ability to learn from the history
of VNE algorithms. We show that it is possible to learn the behavior
of algorithms and how to integrate this knowledge when solving future
problem instances.

\subsection{HyperFlex: Towards Flexible, Reliable and Dynamic SDN Virtualization Layer}

The virtualization of Software Defined Networks (SDN) allows multiple tenants
to share a physical SDN infrastructure, where each tenant can bring its own
controller for a flexible control of its virtual SDN network (vSDN). In order
to virtualize SDN networks, a network hypervisor is deployed between the
physical infrastructure and the tenants' controllers. We present, HyperFlex, a
flexible, reliable and dynamic SDN virtualization layer. HyperFlex achieves
the flexibility of deploying hypervisor functions as software or alternatively
using available processing capabilities of network nodes. It also provides
resources isolation for the control plane of vSDNs. Additionally, HyperFlex
supports the dynamic migration of network hypervisor instances on run time.
These features are key steps towards vigorous slicing in 5G.
